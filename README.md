# S Language Emulator

This is a minimal web-based emulator for the theoretical "S" programming language, designed for learning about computability and low-level programming models. It supports basic operations, label jumps, and conditional branching.

---

## Features
- Minimal and responsive UI  
- Supports `+1`, `-1`, and `+0`/`-0` operations (copying values)  
- Label definition and `GOTO` support  
- Conditional branching with `IF A != B GOTO LBL`  
- Dark/light mode toggle  
- Infinite loop detection after 10,000 steps  

---

## Language Syntax
```
[START] 
X <- Y + 1 
X <- Y - 1 
X <- Y + 0 
IF X != Y GOTO END 
GOTO START
```

## Future Improvements
- Add support for output instructions (e.g. `PRINT X`)
- Add input field for register initialization
- Add share/export features (e.g. shareable code snippets)
